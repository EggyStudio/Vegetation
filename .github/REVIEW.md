# Review

Reviewed up to `63fc628`, item 2, pushed at 12:31 on 2026-10-31 with `41b4925`, item 1, after the
owner's first commit, its run green at 12:35 on the three systems in about three minutes, the first
of this repository. Both commits keep the form, the three-mark subject, one sentence, the owner's
identity as author and committer, no trailer (N 7.2 and N 7.6 kept at the first commit); the library
references no engine (N 2.1). The documents are the engines' with the engine's name replaced and the
engine-only lines dropped, COMMITS.md the game's with N 7.1's pointer rule in place of the legacy
branch line, .gitignore with the dump folder, .claude and .ref; AGENTS.md's devlog row carries no
link until DEVLOG.md exists and its table of areas gains the rows item 2 adds. The skeleton sets
ImportDirectoryBuildTargets false, since a submodule under modules/ would inherit an engine's
Directory.Build.targets, makes a missing summary an error, loads the assembly by name in its one
test, and build/version.sh prints 0.1.0; the strict build 0 warnings and 0 errors, the test passing.
After it `7ec59cf`, the norm alone, the seven repositories named, pushed at 14:51 on 2026-11-03,
with no run since the build passes over the review's files; it keeps the form. Before it `472e7fa`,
the owner's first commit alone.

## Now

The order the owner set on 2026-10-31 for the six modules, this one holding the species, the
skeleton grown from a seed, the tree and grass meshes through the modeling, the texture sets and the
placement. The documents first, then the rest as the other projects have it, then the engines taking
the module. Items 1 and 2 are the game's session's, being free while the game waits on the engine's
package; item 3 is the session's that owns the code today; item 4 is each engine's session's. Among
the six this module comes fourth, after Levels and once BevyCSharp's item 83 is done, on Modeling.

1. **The documents, one commit.** AGENTS.md on the game's shape (one paragraph saying what the
    module is and that no engine is referenced, N 2.1; the documents table with STYLE, COMMITS,
    REVIEW, NORM and DEVLOG; building and testing; Where things are with a row a folder; the
    conventions, the commit form among them), README.md (what the module is, how an engine takes it
    as a submodule, `dotnet build` and `dotnet test`), `.github/STYLE.md`, `COMMITS.md` and
    `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` as the engines' with the engine's name replaced, `.gitignore` of the
    engines' shape with `/.github/dump/` in it, `.gitattributes`. The game's AGENTS.md and the
    engines' documents are the models; nothing is written that the module does not have yet. This
    commit is the first test of the commit form here, N 7.2 and N 7.6, read by the reviewing session
    before it is pushed. Done at `41b4925`.

2. **The skeleton, one commit after item 1.** `Vegetation.slnx`, `Vegetation/Vegetation.csproj` as a
    class library on net10.0 with `Nullable` and `ImplicitUsings` in `Directory.Build.props`,
    `Vegetation.Tests/` on xunit with one test that the library loads, `build/version.txt` at `0.1`
    and `build/version.sh` as the engines', and `.github/workflows/build.yml` on a push, `test (os)`
    on ubuntu-24.04, windows-latest and macos-15 with `dotnet build Vegetation.slnx -warnaserror`
    and `dotnet test Vegetation.Tests --no-build`, a time limit on every job with its reason,
    `permissions` read and the engines' concurrency group. Green on the three systems before item 3.
    Done at `63fc628`.

3. **The code's move.** The source is BevyCSharp's Vegetation, Trees, TreeSpecies, TreeSkeleton,
TreeTextureSet and the grass of its item 83, moved after 83's phases are done, each engine binding
the leaves' material, the wind, the impostors and the light through as its renderer has them. One
commit a part, the tests coming with the code, the strict build and the suite green, a Shared line
in the engines' REVIEW.md when a part lands. Items written by the reviewing session when item 2 is
green and the owning session is free.

4. **The engines take the module.** Each engine adds this repository as a git submodule under
`modules/` and references its project, its workflows checking submodules out, its own folder for
this code becoming the binding of the module's interfaces (N 2.1) and the rest deleted; a change
used by an engine is committed here first and pushed before the engine's commit that moves the
pointer. One commit an engine, after item 3's first part.

## Verdicts

None yet.

## Decisions

1. **The repository's birth.** The owner made this repository on 2026-10-31 at 12:03 among six,
Modeling, Levels, Landscape, RadianceCascades, Tools beside it, after the ideas recorded as
3DEngine's Decision 78 and BevyCSharp's Decision 71, to hold the species, the skeleton grown from a
seed, the tree and grass meshes through the modeling, the texture sets and the placement as one
library both engines use rather than one implementation an engine. The owner set the order the same
day, the documents first, then the rest as the other projects have it, then the engines taking the
module, and said the modules may be tried at once beside the engine's global illumination work
(3DEngine Decision 79).

2. **A git submodule, not a package.** The owner chose on 2026-10-31 that the engines take the
module as a git submodule built as a project of their own, since a package's upload, wait, test and
pack is slower to iterate than a commit. A change is committed here first; the reviewing session
pushes this repository before the engine's commit that moves its pointer; the workflows check
submodules out. The game keeps using the engine through the engine's package.

3. **The module knows no engine.** N 2.1. The module references no engine, package or bridge; what
it needs of a renderer, a world, a scheduler or a file system it takes through interfaces it
declares, which each engine implements where it binds the module. A type of an engine's in this
repository is a fault.

4. **The repository's terms are the owner's.** The repository was made by the owner with its terms
   file in place, which stands as the owner set it and is spoken of nowhere else.

5. **Who writes here.** The game's session writes items 1 and 2 for the six modules, being free
while the game waits on the engine's package; the session that owns the code today moves it (item
3), BevyCSharp's for Vegetation and Levels, 3DEngine's for Modeling and the cascades, the reviewing
session's scripts going into Tools; each engine's session binds the module (item 4). Every session
reads REVIEW.md's head, its items and the Replies before a batch, as N 7.7 says, and the reviewing
session pushes.
